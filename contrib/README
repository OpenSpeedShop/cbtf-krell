Each directory contains an example of a simple CBTF tool.  There is also a tarball containing a CBTF tool template that, after a little setup, will allow you to make and compile a new CBTF tool from your home directory (or any dir you like outside of the CBTF tree).

Below is a quick description of each tool, see the README inside each directory for more information.  Note that every tool has a cbtf_topology file in its directory that file is used to setup the MRNet topology and should be edited to include the correct nodes to use for the MRNet.

memTool - a tool to see the memory usage for each MPI proc across many nodes.

psTool - a tool to run the ps command on backends then compare the output and
         tell the user what procs are running on all backends and what nodes are
         running unique procs.

stack - a debugging tool for MPI applications, it will run gstack on each proc 
        across many nodes and group the output into clusters to allow the user
        to quickly identify any procs that are in different states.

tbonFS - an implementation of TBON-FS in CBTF that allows you to do (group) 
         file operations on many backend nodes at the same time.

XXXXtool.tar.gz - is the tarball for a tool template, just untar it to your home
                  directory and follow the README instructions to make your own 
                  tool.
