psTool - a tool to run the ps command on backends then compare the output and
         tell the user what procs are running on all backends and what nodes are
         running unique procs.

Run pstool after setting up the cbtf_topology file.

Currently the topology file used is the default ~/.cbtf/cbtf_topology it must be in the form of:
rr-dev-fe.lanl.gov:0 => 
  rr-dev-fe.lanl.gov:1 ;

rr-dev-fe.lanl.gov:1 =>
  rra011a.rr.lanl.gov:0 
  rra012a.rr.lanl.gov:0 ;

You must have one filter node and two backend nodes.
