repeatingMemtool - a tool to see the memory usage for each MPI proc across many nodes.

Run repeatingMemtool with the number of backend nodes, the name of an application, and the time step associated with each delay between repititions (in seconds) to see the memory usage for that application.  If the name is an MPI application the tool will find all the running procedures on every backend node.  Below is an example using an MPI application called mpi_malloc-tu running on two nodes:

You can add any number of backends just specify the number with the -be option.
