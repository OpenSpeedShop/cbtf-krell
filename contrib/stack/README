stack - a debugging tool for MPI applications, it will run gstack on each proc 
        across many nodes and group the output into clusters to allow the user
        to quickly identify any procs that are in different states.

Run stack with the name of an application to see the gstack output for each procedure with that application name.  Similar stack traces will be grouped together.
