The intent of this client is to allow running daemonTools defined entirely
by their xml and plugin component libraries.  i.e. the daemonTool client
does not provide command line options specific to any needs of a tool
specified in the xml.  The tool's xml must define a Frontend component
network (run in the deamonTool client process) and a Backend component
network (run in the libcbtf-mrnet-backend process).  While it it possible
in CBTF to run filters on the client and backend processes, the daemonTool
client would use the Filter network of the xml (if provided) to run in
the MRNet communication processes (CP's). These CP processes are actually
mrnet_commnode executables running at the intermediate levels of the
MRNet tree and loading filter libraries as specified in the xml.
The Filter <Depth> </Depth> specification controls the placement of
filters at specific levels of the MRNet tree.

An example usage for a tool name myTool.

daemonTool --tool myTool --numBE 512

The tool myTool would be implemented as a collection of component
plugin libraries and an xml file that contains the tools implementation.

The xml and component plugin library naming conventions are (where myTool
represents the tool name):
myTool.xml
myTool.so (contains Frontend,Filters,Backend components and any mrnet type converters).
