# wrapper for libcbtf-mrnet-backend.
#
# For clusters using rsh, this wrapper is needed around the
# actual libcbtf-mrnet-backend binary so it can find its
# dependent libraries. CBTF will need to modify it's callsite
# for  libcbtf-mrnet-backend to call through an environment variable.
# CBTF_MRNET_BACKEND_PATH.
# For this installation its location is:
# @cbtfkdir@/sbin/cbtf_libcbtf_mrnet_backend.
#
# rsh starts with no env.  We need at a minumum the library
# paths set for cbtf and mrnet.
# Base these on the configuration values.
#
mrnetlibdir=@libmrnetlibdir@
cbtflibdir=@cbtflibdir@

# location of the real mrnet_commnode.
#
libcbtfmrnetbackend=@cbtfdir@/bin/libcbtf-mrnet-backend

#set up the LD_LIBRARYPATH
#
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${mrnetlibdir}:${cbtflibdir}

# now call the real mrnet_commnode
#
exec ${libcbtfmrnetbackend} $@
