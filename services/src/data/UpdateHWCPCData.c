/**
 * Update HWC PC data.
 *
 * Updates the specified program counter (PC) sampling data buffer with the
 * passed PC address.
 *
 * @note    Multiple samples at the same PC address within a given buffer are
 *          indicated by incrementing  sample event counts rather than repeating the
 *          PC address. This helps compress the data in the common case where
 *          a degree of spatial locality is present. A hash table is used to
 *          accelerate the determination of whether an addresss is already in 
 *          the buffer. This concept is losely based on the technique employed
 *          by Digital/Compaq/HP's DCPI.
